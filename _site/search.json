The use of terms like “border” and “enforcement” aligns with Republican policies that emphasize the construction of physical barriers, increased immigration law enforcement, and tighter restrictions on immigration, particularly from Mexico and Central America (Zolberg, 2006).\nOn the other hand, the Democratic Party’s rhetoric links immigration to issues of public finance and economic policy. Democrats often emphasize the economic benefits of immigration, highlighting the positive contributions of immigrants to the labor market and the economy at large (Peri, 2016). This reflects the party’s more inclusive stance, advocating for comprehensive immigration reform that includes pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and the protection of immigrant rights (Wong, 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speeches were cleaned and tokenized using quanteda, removing punctuation, stopwords, and short words.\ntoks &lt;- tokens(pres_df_stm$clean_text, remove_punct = TRUE, remove_symbols = TRUE)\ntoks_nostop &lt;- tokens_select(toks, pattern = stopwords(\"en\"), selection = \"remove\", min_nchar = 3)\n\n\n\nAn STM model was used to discover the key topics within the speeches, particularly focusing on their temporal evolution.\npres_stm &lt;- stm(docs, vocab, K = 0, prevalence = ~ s(date_clean), data = meta, init.type = \"Spectral\")\npres_stm_effects &lt;- estimateEffect(1:73 ~ s(date_clean), stmobj = pres_stm, metadata = meta, uncertainty = \"None\")\n\n\n\nTo explore the context in which immigration-related terms were used, word embeddings were applied to analyze semantic differences between the two political parties.\nimmig_toks &lt;- tokens_context(x = toks, pattern = c(\"immigration\", \"immigrants\"), window = 8L)\nimmig_dfm &lt;- dfm(immig_toks)\n\n\n\nThe cosine similarity analysis revealed key words associated with each party’s framing of immigration.
