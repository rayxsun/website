    "text": "Partisan Framing of Immigration\n\n\n\nCosine Similarity Plot\n\n\nThe Republican Party’s discourse reflects the party’s traditional stance of prioritizing border security and strict immigration controls, often positioning immigration as a threat to national security (Hajnal & Rivera, 2014). The use of terms like “border” and “enforcement” aligns with Republican policies that emphasize the construction of physical barriers, increased immigration law enforcement, and tighter restrictions on immigration, particularly from Mexico and Central America (Zolberg, 2006).\nOn the other hand, the Democratic Party’s rhetoric links immigration to issues of public finance and economic policy. Democrats often emphasize the economic benefits of immigration, highlighting the positive contributions of immigrants to the labor market and the economy at large (Peri, 2016). This reflects the party’s more inclusive stance, advocating for comprehensive immigration reform that includes pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and the protection of immigrant rights (Wong, 2017)."

Drawing from Esping-Andersen’s (1990) welfare state typology (liberal, conservative, and social democratic welfare regimes) and theories on the sexual division of labor, the analysis investigates whether public spending on family benefits has gendered effects on labor force participation (LFPR) and unemployment rates (UR). Data from 18 OECD countries from 1999 to 2019 is used, and the project employs multilevel modeling to assess these dynamics."

    "text": "Model Justification\nThe multilevel model with entity and time effects is used for two reasons. First, the distributions of men’s and women’s LFPR and UR, as well as the LFPR and UR gender gaps, differ among the three types of welfare regimes (liberal, conservative, social democratic), as seen in Figures 2 and 3. For instance, group 1 (liberal) countries have a female LFPR between 70% and 75%, which is lower than the 75%-80% seen in conservative and social democratic countries. Additionally, the effects of family benefits differ by welfare group, as shown in Figure 4. Therefore, it is more appropriate to use multilevel modeling, which accounts for these differences, rather than pooled ordinary linear regression. Furthermore, the effects may change over time, necessitating the inclusion of time effects."

A 1% increase in family spending results in a 0.57% increase in men’s LFPR, indicating that family policies may disproportionately benefit men in terms of labor force participation.\nWomen’s and Men’s Unemployment Rates: Family benefits reduce both women’s and men’s UR, with a larger effect on women. A 1% increase in family spending reduces women’s UR by 1%, while men’s UR decreases by 0.6%.\nGender Gap in Unemployment: The increase in family benefits also helps narrow the UR gender gap by 0.44%. This suggests that family policies might be more effective at addressing unemployment disparities than labor force participation disparities.\nMixed Results on Gender Gaps in LFPR: The models do not show significant effects of family policies on reducing LFPR gender gaps, indicating that while family policies help with unemployment, they may not promote gender parity in workforce participation.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2 Regression Table"

First, the models and variables may not fully capture the gendered effects of family policies. Future research could explore additional datasets and variable constructions to better assess these impacts. Second, the analysis may have omitted important variables, such as the financial crises and other exogenous shocks that occurred between 1999 and 2019, which could affect both LFPR and UR. These events merit further exploration in future studies."

    "text": "Analysis of News Quality by Characteristics\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nHigh-Quality News Characteristics (Figure 1): The dictionary-based analysis shows that objectivity (29.5%) and accuracy (17.9%) are the most frequently mentioned characteristics of high-quality journalism. This aligns with academic literature on media trust, which emphasizes that the public perceives neutrality and fact-based reporting as core components of good journalism (Kovach & Rosenstiel, 2014). Characteristics such as clarity (6.8%), source credibility (8.9%), transparency (4.0%), and thoroughness (2.3%) are mentioned less frequently, but remain important components of journalistic quality. These findings are consistent with studies that indicate the public places greater emphasis on neutrality and fact-checking when assessing news quality, while other attributes like clarity and transparency are often taken for granted (Bennett, 2016). The lower emphasis on transparency and thoroughness may also reflect a broader public assumption that these characteristics should be inherent to objective, accurate reporting.\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nLow-Quality News Characteristics (Figure 2): When it comes to low-quality news, the most frequently mentioned characteristics are opinionated content (19.5%) and bias (17.5%). This suggests that people associate poor journalism with overly subjective reporting and unbalanced coverage, findings that align with broader concerns about the rise of partisan media (Stroud, 2011). Sensationalism (7.5%) and misinformation (3.8%) also contribute to the public’s negative assessment of journalism but are mentioned less frequently, reflecting the public’s frustration with exaggerated or inaccurate reporting. The presence of ads (3.1%) is seen as less directly linked to journalistic quality, though concerns about the commercialization of news are discussed in media studies as a broader issue affecting the industry (McNair, 2009)."

    "text": "Political Differences in News Quality Perceptions\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nHigh-Quality News by Political Party (Figure 3): There are striking political differences in how high-quality journalism is perceived. Democrats (50.2%) are significantly more likely than Republicans (15.4%) or Independents (28.9%) to emphasize high-quality news characteristics. This aligns with research showing that Democrats have greater trust in mainstream media, viewing traditional journalistic standards like objectivity and accuracy as being upheld by the outlets they consume (Pew Research Center, 2020). In contrast, Republicans are more likely to view mainstream media as biased, which could explain their lower emphasis on these high-quality characteristics. This sentiment is well-documented in studies showing that Republicans tend to distrust mainstream outlets and often turn to ideologically aligned media (Ladd, 2011). As a result, they may be less likely to mention traditional markers of journalistic quality because they believe these standards are not being met by the media they encounter.\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nLow-Quality News by Political Party (Figure 4): In contrast to high-quality news perceptions, there is less variation across political parties in how respondents describe low-quality journalism. Democrats (46%), Independents (41.8%), Others (43.7%), and Republicans (38.6%) all mention low-quality news characteristics at similar rates, suggesting that there is bipartisan agreement on what constitutes poor journalism. Bias, opinionated content, and sensationalism are widely recognized as indicators of low-quality news, regardless of political affiliation. This finding is supported by research showing that while media trust is polarized, there is broad agreement across the political spectrum on what constitutes bad journalism (Iyengar & Hahn, 2009). Both Democrats and Republicans express frustration with biased or subjective reporting, highlighting that while their perceptions of high-quality journalism diverge, their understanding of low-quality journalism is more consistent."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis project illustrates the polarized perceptions of high-quality journalism across political parties, with Democrats emphasizing traditional journalistic standards like objectivity and accuracy, while Republicans are more skeptical of these qualities. However, there is bipartisan agreement on the negative traits associated with low-quality news, particularly bias and opinionated content. The use of a dictionary-based approach provides a transparent and systematic way to measure how frequently these characteristics are mentioned by respondents, allowing us to quantify public opinion on news quality across the political spectrum. These findings have significant implications for both news producers and consumers, highlighting the challenges of maintaining journalistic integrity in a polarized media environment.\nReferences\n\nBennett, W.
