    "text": "This project examines the factors influencing China’s Official Financing (COF) allocations to Southeast Asian countries, focusing on three key dimensions: economic interdependency, territorial disputes, and institutional embeddedness. Using multilevel mixed-effects models, the analysis accounts for variations across countries and years.\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Interdependence:\n\nH1(a): A higher proportion of imports from China is positively associated with increased COF allocations.\nH1(b): A higher proportion of exports to China is associated with increased COF allocations.\n\nTerritorial Disputes and Resolution:\n\nH2(a): Increased territorial dispute intensity is negatively associated with COF allocations.\nH2(b): Peaceful resolution of territorial disputes is negatively associated with COF allocations.\n\nInstitutional Embeddedness:\n\nH3(a): Membership in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is positively associated with COF allocations.\nH3(b): Membership in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is positively associated with COF allocations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dependent variable in our analysis is the log of COF allocations, which includes Official Development Assistance (ODA), Other Official Flows (OOF), and VOF data. Independent variables include: - Trade Dependency: The percentage of a country’s imports from and exports to China. - Dispute Intensity: Measured using a binary indicator for territorial disputes. - Institutional Participation: Binary indicators for membership in the BRI and AIIB.\n\n\n\nI only use economic interdependency model building to show the steps.

    "text": "Methods Used: Structural Topic Modeling (STM), Word Embeddings, Cosine Similarity, quanteda\nThis project analyzes U.S. presidential speeches from 1789 to 2023, comparing how Democratic and Republican presidents frame immigration. Using STM and word embeddings, the study uncovers significant rhetorical differences between the two parties, highlighting contrasting priorities in the political discourse on immigration.\n\n\n\nRepublican Presidents: Words such as “border”, “enforcement”, “patrol”, and “aliens” suggest a focus on security and law enforcement.\nDemocratic Presidents: Words like “spending”, “taxes”, and “economic” indicate a framing of immigration around economic issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCosine Similarity Plot\n\n\nThe Republican Party’s discourse reflects the party’s traditional stance of prioritizing border security and strict immigration controls, often positioning immigration as a threat to national security (Hajnal & Rivera, 2014). The use of terms like “border” and “enforcement” aligns with Republican policies that emphasize the construction of physical barriers, increased immigration law enforcement, and tighter restrictions on immigration, particularly from Mexico and Central America (Zolberg, 2006).\nOn the other hand, the Democratic Party’s rhetoric links immigration to issues of public finance and economic policy. Democrats often emphasize the economic benefits of immigration, highlighting the positive contributions of immigrants to the labor market and the economy at large (Peri, 2016). This reflects the party’s more inclusive stance, advocating for comprehensive immigration reform that includes pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and the protection of immigrant rights (Wong, 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speeches were cleaned and tokenized using quanteda, removing punctuation, stopwords, and short words.\ntoks &lt;- tokens(pres_df_stm$clean_text, remove_punct = TRUE, remove_symbols = TRUE)\ntoks_nostop &lt;- tokens_select(toks, pattern = stopwords(\"en\"), selection = \"remove\", min_nchar = 3)\n\n\n\nAn STM model was used to discover the key topics within the speeches, particularly focusing on their temporal evolution.\npres_stm &lt;- stm(docs, vocab, K = 0, prevalence = ~ s(date_clean), data = meta, init.type = \"Spectral\")\npres_stm_effects &lt;- estimateEffect(1:73 ~ s(date_clean), stmobj = pres_stm, metadata = meta, uncertainty = \"None\")\n\n\n\nTo explore the context in which immigration-related terms were used, word embeddings were applied to analyze semantic differences between the two political parties.\nimmig_toks &lt;- tokens_context(x = toks, pattern = c(\"immigration\", \"immigrants\"), window = 8L)\nimmig_dfm &lt;- dfm(immig_toks)\n\n\n\nThe cosine similarity analysis revealed key words associated with each party’s framing of immigration.
