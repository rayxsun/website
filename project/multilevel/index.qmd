# A Multilevel Mixed-Effects Approach: Modeling the Determinants of China's Official Financing in Southeast Asia

## Introduction

This project examines the factors influencing China’s Official Financing (COF) allocations to Southeast Asian countries, focusing on three key dimensions: economic interdependency, territorial disputes, and institutional embeddedness. Using multilevel mixed-effects models, the analysis accounts for variations across countries and years.

## Hypotheses

- **Economic Interdependence**:
  - **H1(a)**: A higher proportion of imports from China is positively associated with increased COF allocations.
  - **H1(b)**: A higher proportion of exports to China is associated with increased COF allocations.
- **Territorial Disputes and Resolution**:
  - **H2(a)**: Increased territorial dispute intensity is negatively associated with COF allocations.
  - **H2(b)**: Peaceful resolution of territorial disputes is negatively associated with COF allocations.

- **Institutional Embeddedness**:
  - **H3(a)**: Membership in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is positively associated with COF allocations.
  - **H3(b)**: Membership in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is positively associated with COF allocations.


## Data
The dependent variable in our analysis is the **log of COF allocations**, which includes Official Development Assistance (ODA), Other Official Flows (OOF), and VOF data.
Independent variables include:
- Trade Dependency: The percentage of a country’s imports from and exports to China.
- Dispute Intensity: Measured using a binary indicator for territorial disputes.
- Institutional Participation: Binary indicators for membership in the BRI and AIIB.

## Model Building Steps and R Code

I only use economic interdependency model building to show the steps. The random intercept model allows for varying intercepts by country, capturing country-specific baseline levels of COF.

### Step 1: Load Packages and Data

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(lme4)  # For mixed-effects modeling
library(readxl)  # To read Excel data
library(tidyverse)  # For data manipulation and visualization

# Load the dataset
df <- read_excel("data.xlsx")

# Log-transform key variables
df <- df %>%
  mutate(log_OFALL = log(OFALL), log_GDPpc = log(GDP_per_capita), 
         log_Pop = log(Population), log_OECD = log(OECD_DAC), 
         log_ADB_Loans = log(ADB_Loans))
```

### Step 2: Build the Null Model (Without Predictors)
I begin by fitting a null model to verify the necessity of multilevel modeling, using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). The ICC value is 0.13, greater than 0.1, meaning the responses are more similar within a cluster.

```r
# Null model (without predictors)
null_model <- lmer(log_OFALL ~ 1 + (1 | Country), data = df, REML = FALSE)

# Display summary and calculate ICC
summary(null_model)
icc <- as.numeric(VarCorr(null_model)$Country[1] / 
                  (VarCorr(null_model)$Country[1] + attr(VarCorr(null_model), "sc")^2))
print(paste("ICC:", round(icc, 3)))  # ICC confirms the necessity of multilevel modeling
```

### Step 3: Random Intercept Model (Only Level 1 Predictors)
I fit a random intercept model using level 1 predictors, including imports, exports, and other economic variables.

```r
# Random intercept model with level 1 predictors
trade_int_1 <- lmer(log_OFALL ~ lag_Imp.Percent.CN + lag_Exp.Percent.CN + 
                    lag_UNSC + lag_log_GDPpc + lag_log_Pop + 
                    lag_Civil_Conflict + lag_Poly + lag_log_OECD + 
                    lag_log_ADB_Loans + (1 | Country), data = df, REML = FALSE)

# Model summary
summary(trade_int_1)
```

### Step 4: Add Level 2 Predictors (Territorial Disputes)
Next, I include SCS_Border and SCS_Features to account for territorial disputes as level 2 predictors.

```r
# Random intercept model with level 1 and level 2 predictors
trade_int_2 <- lmer(log_OFALL ~ lag_Imp.Percent.CN + lag_Exp.Percent.CN + 
                    lag_UNSC + lag_log_GDPpc + lag_log_Pop + 
                    lag_Civil_Conflict + lag_Poly + lag_log_OECD + 
                    lag_log_ADB_Loans + SCS_Border + SCS_Features + 
                    (1 | Country), data = df, REML = FALSE)

# Model summary
summary(trade_int_2)
```

### Step 5: Adding Random Effects for Year
We also tested including year as a random effect to capture variations across time.

```r
# Random intercept model with year as a random effect
trade_int_3 <- lmer(log_OFALL ~ lag_Imp.Percent.CN + lag_Exp.Percent.CN + 
                    lag_UNSC + lag_log_GDPpc + lag_log_Pop + 
                    lag_Civil_Conflict + lag_Poly + lag_log_OECD + 
                    lag_log_ADB_Loans + SCS_Border + SCS_Features + 
                    (1 | Country) + (1 | Year), data = df, REML = FALSE)

# Model summary
summary(trade_int_3)
```

### Step 6: Random Slopes (Addressing Singularity)
Finally, we attempted to fit a model with random slopes for imports and exports but encountered singularity issues, which indicated overfitting.
```r
# Random intercept and slope model (with singularity issues)
trade_slop_1 <- lmer(log_OFALL ~ lag_Imp.Percent.CN + lag_Exp.Percent.CN + 
                     lag_UNSC + lag_log_GDPpc + lag_log_Pop + 
                     lag_Civil_Conflict + lag_Poly + lag_log_OECD + 
                     lag_log_ADB_Loans + (1 + lag_Imp.Percent.CN + 
                     lag_Exp.Percent.CN | Country), data = df, REML = FALSE)

# Check for singularity
isSingular(trade_slop_1)
```

### Model Comparison
We compare the models using ANOVA to identify the best-fitting model. The random intercept model with level 1 predictors (Model 1) proves to be superior in terms of parsimony and diagnostic performance.
```r
# Compare models using ANOVA
anova(trade_int_1, trade_int_2)
anova(trade_int_1, trade_int_3)
```

## Descriptive Analysis

Key Insight: Countries like Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and the Philippines experienced significant increases in COF from 2015 onwards, particularly during periods of heightened South China Sea tensions.

## Regression Analysis

- Key Insight: Imports from China significantly influence COF allocations (p < 0.05), supporting H1(a), while exports do not significantly impact COF, rejecting H1(b). For every 1% increase in the proportion of imports from China in the previous year, the expected log COF increases by 0.11 (Model 1).

- Key Insight: Territorial disputes and resolutions show mixed impacts, with peaceful resolutions negatively associated with COF allocations, rejecting H2.

![Table 2: The Regression Results of Disputes and Resolution on COF Allocations](table1.png)

- Key Insight: BRI and AIIB memberships do not have statistically significant effects on COF allocations, rejecting H3.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that economic interdependency—particularly in terms of imports from China—plays a significant role in shaping China's COF allocations. However, territorial disputes and institutional participation show more nuanced and often insignificant effects. The random intercept model with level 1 predictors provided the best performance, balancing parsimony and robustness.
