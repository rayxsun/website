I prefer to hear opinions from experts versus journalists - in the article presented"", an economist or CDC official talking about jobs would've been better than a journalist editorializing (I know there's no such thing as bias-free media, but I'd prefer my bias comes from people who know the topic either via study or firsthand experience). I like to cross-reference important stories that may be reported inaccurately, especially using foreign media like the BBC or Al-Jazeera English because their biases will not be the same as ours generally. The more editorializing or spin I hear in something, the more likely I am to try a few different sources to get a better picture. I think social media, particularly Facebook, is a terrible way to remain informed and prefer RSS feeds from news organizations that actually do their own research - for more mainstream news, AP News and for specialized topics,"" places like Propublica. I think overall media literacy is pretty low and do not go to social media to just hear what my friends and family think. ","I look for lurid editorializing: emotionally charged language from talking heads (as opposed to firsthand witnesses or experts"", as mentioned in the last question). I look for a lack of numbers, or numbers presented out of context.
